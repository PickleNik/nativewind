<Callout type="warn" title="CAUTION">
NativeWind's default theme is not yet designed for native devices and still uses breakpoints that were mostly designed for web.

NativeWind's responsive design works identically to Tailwind CSS, please refer to the [official Tailwind CSS docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) for more information.
