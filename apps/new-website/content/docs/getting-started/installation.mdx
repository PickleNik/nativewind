# Installation

> NativeWind works with both Expo and framework-less React Native projects but Expo provides a more streamlined experience.
> 
> **Web**: If you'd like to use Metro to bundle for a website or App Clip and you are **not** using Expo, you will need either Expo's Metro config `@expo/metro-config` or to manually use Tailwind CLI to generate a CSS file.
