## Usage

<Usage />

<Callout type="warn" title="CAUTION">
`space-{n}` was temporary removed in `v4`. You can now use [`gap-*`](../flexbox/gap.mdx) utilities to add space between elements. We will re-add it once React Native adds support for `display: 'block'`. 
</Callout>

## Compatibility

<Compatibility
  none={[
    "space-{n}",
    "space-[n]",
    "space-x-{n}",
    "space-x-[n]",
    "space-y-{n}",

    "space-x-reverse",
    "space-y-reverse",
