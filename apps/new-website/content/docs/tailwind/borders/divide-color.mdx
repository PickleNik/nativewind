> divideOpacity (native only)
> 
> For performance reasons, NativeWind renders with the `corePlugin` `divideOpacity` disabled. This plugin allows the divide color to dynamically change its opacity via the `--tw-divide-opacity` variable. Instead, the opacity is set as a static value in the `color` property.
> 
> If you need to use this feature, you can enable it by adding the following to your `tailwind.config.js` file:
> 
> ```js title=tailwind.config.js
> module.exports = {
>   /* ...  */
>   corePlugin: {
>     divideOpacity: true,
>   },
> };
> ```
